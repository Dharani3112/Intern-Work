# 📚 E-commerce to Bookstore Conversion - COMPLETED ✅

## 🎯 Project Overview
Successfully converted a generic e-commerce Flask application into a specialized **bookstore application**. The conversion transforms product management into book-specific functionality with proper genre categorization, author information, ISBN tracking, and publishing details.

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. **Database Model Transformation** 
- ✅ Converted `Product` → `Book` model with book-specific fields:
  - `title`, `author`, `isbn`, `publisher`, `publication_year`
  - `pages`, `language`, `genre` (replaced category), `format`
- ✅ Updated `ProductImage` → `BookImage` with `book_id` foreign key
- ✅ Updated `CartItem` and `Review` models to reference `book_id`
- ✅ Proper database constraints and relationships

### 2. **Backend Route Conversion**
- ✅ Updated all Flask routes to use Book model instead of Product
- ✅ Converted route paths: `/product/<id>` → `/book/<id>`
- ✅ Updated cart functionality: `product_id` → `book_id`
- ✅ Converted admin routes: `admin_add_product` → `admin_add_book`
- ✅ Updated search to filter by `genre` instead of `category`
- ✅ Fixed all template data passing to use Book objects

### 3. **Frontend Template Updates**
- ✅ Updated all HTML templates for bookstore branding
- ✅ Changed site title from "Logo" to "Bookstore"
- ✅ Updated search placeholders: "Search products" → "Search books"
- ✅ Converted product display to show book-specific fields (title, author, genre)
- ✅ Created book-specific templates: `book.html`, `admin_add_book.html`, `admin_edit_book.html`
- ✅ Updated navigation and UI elements for bookstore theme

### 4. **Functionality Conversion**
- ✅ **Search & Filtering**: Genre-based instead of category-based
- ✅ **Cart System**: Handles books with author and title display
- ✅ **Admin Panel**: Book management with ISBN, publisher, publication year
- ✅ **Review System**: Book reviews with proper book_id references
- ✅ **API Endpoints**: All APIs now serve book data

### 5. **Database Setup & Sample Data**
- ✅ Created SQLite database with new Book schema
- ✅ Added 6 sample books with realistic data and cover images
- ✅ Proper foreign key relationships and constraints
